# Go port of the Aspen web framework (see [here](http://aspen.io))

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gittip/aspen-go.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gittip/aspen-go)

Aspen in Go currently supports rendered, negotiated, and static Simplates as
[described here](http://aspen.io/simplates/). The only template engine
currently implemented is Go's standard library `text/template`.
